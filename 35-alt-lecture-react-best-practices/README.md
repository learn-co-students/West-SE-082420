# React Best Practices

Let's learn some best practices by refactoring yesterday's Pets code!

## By the end of this lesson, we'll be able to:
- implement e.stopPropagation()
- Determine whether a component is a presentation or container component
- Reduce state and put it in the right place
- Make our components smaller - SRP
- Make our code more concise using spread and destructuring
- Make our code easier to understand by logically naming variables, keys, methods
- BONUS: organize our code
