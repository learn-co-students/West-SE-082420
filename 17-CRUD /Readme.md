- this will do everything for you and you are not aloud to use it until after mod-2, you must first learn how rails works, it generates a lot of files you don't need or know how to use yet so it's very obvious when you use it. **It is forbidden on the Code  Challenges and Projects**

```

```
rails g controller name_of_controller
```

```
rails g migration add_new_column_name_to_table_name column_name:datatype 
```
- adds a new column
```
rails g migration remove_column_name_from_table_name column_name:datatype
```
- removes a column

```
rails g resource ModelName column_name:datatype column_name2:datatype2
```
- will create model, controller, views and routes

### Routes 
```
#method 'route', to: 'controller#action'
get '/candy_stores', to: 'candy_stores#show'
```
- custom route
```
#resources :model_name 
resources :candy_stores
